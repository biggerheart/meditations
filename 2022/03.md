# 3, 29, tuesday, sun

quote from the original meditations

remove the thought i am hurt, and the hurt itself is removed

you can live here in this world just as you intend to live when you have left it

my soul, will you ever be good, simple, individual, bare, brighter than the body that covers you?

quotes from the original meditations

you may depart this life at any moment

abandon vain hopes, rescue yourself
