what is life about? meaning? value? purpose?

stoicism? nihilism? variable? function? recursive?

all/none of the above?

could it be a sort of "relativity"?

let dy/dx be life of x with respect to y.

let x be a human

example one, u is the universe, du/dx = 0, i.e. the life of a human (x) is nothing with respective to the whole (u).

example two, y is a friend/family of x, dy/dx > 0, i.e. the human (x) is good with respective to the friend/family (y). similarly, y is an enemy, dy/dx < 0.

example three, z is a work, science, art, business, etc, dz/dx is what the person (x) adds/subtracts/or not with respective to the work (z).

chain rule applies.

last example, a possibly obvious one, dx/dx = 1. a test of identity.

so again what is life about? or what is dx, it does not appear defined or a matter.

what to do if one has a life? possible actions, find y, z, etc and change dy/dx, dz/dx, etc, or not.

finally, now imagine life is a sort of game. after one life of x ends, x will have another life, at a different time, space, universe, in a different form, all random (the new life is independent from the ended life, no favor/punishment). x can bring only one (w) into the new life and leave anything else in the ended life. which w will x choose? argmax(dw/dx)? argmax(dx/dw)? none?
