the finding you movie appeared a romance comedy but it has more good stuff. unreal beauty of ireland, haunting irish culture and people, open-mindedness, kindness, fellowship, trade-off. weather and food sound awful though but i am not going to an irish bar for food or suntan.

andrew yang impressed me in the yang speaks podcast with his advice to the younger himself. live at peace with unmet expectations/goals. the other mindset i learned from this man is the abundance mindset.

in another episode of the neil degrasse typson podcast, he made the case for not knowing iq test result. imagine if the (at most inaccurate yet widely believed) result is less than what is expected of a kid's dream, would the kid knowing that still try as hard? or in the opposite case, why would a genius kid need to work as much as an average kid? the point is to pursue the dream to one's best despite anything else, people, nature, etc.

when x says you will/will not y, where x can be anyone, yourself, someone, "they", society, nature, etc and y can be anything or any state, proving/testing whether x is wrong or right is a possible new experience in life.

i watched the human factor, a documentary, in the afternoon. the relationship, or the lack thereof, between the middle east two remains a tough problem to this day that smart and powerful figures have worked for decades but did not succeed.

i have given it a bit of thinking, or more exactly guessing, about what a successful solution might look like. i acknowledge that i know as little about either an alien would and make my own assumptions.

possible solution a: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. a common enemy to both is an incentive for both to stop hurting the other.

possible solution b: love.

in the morinig, i, for some irrelevant reasons, watched (parts of) the voyage music video from a very famous japanese musician ayumi hamasaki and saw in the video that the brave man, confronted and outnumbered by an armed force, stood to protect the woman. i began wondering how good it is an end of one's life.

there are way over a millions ways to die. being eaten by bacteria, eaten by a lion, eat a poisonous mushroom, and so on. none desirable occurs to me. with biological death being the only exit, dying to save a loved one feels the best imaginable option. 

i recalled some evidence for this claim. exhibit a is the end of the titanic movie. exhibit b is the end of a certain most known figure in religions.

in the evening, i watched the autumn sonata movie. it gave me things to think about mother/parent and love.
