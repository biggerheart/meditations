in the morinig, i, for some irrelevant reasons, watched (parts of) the voyage music video from a very famous japanese musician ayumi hamasaki and saw in the video that the brave man, confronted and outnumbered by an armed force, stood to protect the woman. i began wondering how good it is an end of one's life.

there are way over a millions ways to die. being eaten by bacteria, eaten by a lion, eat a poisonous mushroom, and so on. none desirable occurs to me. with biological death being the only exit, dying to save a loved one feels the best imaginable option. 

i recalled some evidence for this claim. exhibit a is the end of the titanic movie. exhibit b is the end of a certain most known figure in religions.

in the evening, i watched the autumn sonata movie. it gave me things to think about mother/parent and love.
