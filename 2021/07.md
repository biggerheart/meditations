i finished reading the book Meditations, authored by Marcus Aurelius, translated by Martin Hammond, which is my favorite now.

i will skip what the book is about since there is abundant information already and another shallow summary would be unnecessary and may be a disservice for the book. but reading the book is like listening to a best friend i have never met from a foreign country and nearly two thousand years ago. and the timing is perfect. had i read it ten years earlier, i would likely be too self-absorbed to appreciate it. if i were to read it ten years later, i might be too old to change my mindset. incidentially, the style of the book is somewhat similar to that of my writings here. for example, both are not meant to be public.

anyone who is open to what life can be about should open this book. but at the same time i am not sure whether it is the life for everyone.
