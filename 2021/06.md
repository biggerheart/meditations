as i recently got interested in irish and british cultures, i read on quora about irish and british and had a thought or a question: are cultures in the world known to us too diverse, not diverse enough, or just right? i don't have a clear answer because i have rather mixed information in mind. and i am not sure whether the question is important. all i can say is i feel like more diversity.

life is a constraint and hopefully more than that. based on my personal experience, it seems that life experience = endure * give , "correctness" or "usefulness" pending testing. my test is straightforward: if i endure more or give more, does my life become more?

the two parts may well be two sides just like many others, offense and defense, yin and yang, for example. on the side of giving, i am not generous nor have much to give now and possibly in the future but i want to experience life through giving more as much as i possibly can. i am just not into getting what i do not want/others want.
